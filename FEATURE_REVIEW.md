- ✅ **Area dimensions** — shows room width × depth below name label in room center

## 6. 3D View
- ✅ Toggle 2D/3D

- ✅ Floor texture
- ✅ Orbit camera controls
- ✅ Room floor fills with labels
- ✅ **Door/window openings** — proper 3D frames, hinged doors, mullion windows, baseboard gaps
- ✅ **Lighting quality** — 3-point setup: warm key sun, cool fill light, rim backlight; hemisphere boost
- 🔧 **3D furniture** — procedural models (sofas, beds, tables, etc.) not imported glTF assets
- ✅ **Material/texture on walls** — wall color property reflected in 3D (interior + exterior)
- ✅ **Ceiling** — per-room ceiling at wall height, visible from inside
- ✅ **First-person walkthrough** — PointerLock walkthrough with WASD look, arrow move, sprint, adjustable eye height/speed

## 7. UI / Layout
- ✅ Top toolbar with project name, undo/redo, 2D/3D toggle
- ✅ Left sidebar with Build/Rooms/Objects tabs
- ✅ Properties panel (right side or integrated)
- ✅ Status bar

## Priority Order (fixing what Jason noticed first)

### Phase 1: Scale & Proportions (CRITICAL — Jason's feedback)
1. ✅ Door/window sizing — default 90cm door, 120cm window, properly scaled to wall (already correct)
2. ✅ Door arc drawing — solid thin arc, thicker door leaf line, jamb ticks at gap edges
3. ✅ Furniture scale — cm dimensions render correctly in 2D (already correct)
4. ✅ Wall thickness — 15cm filled rectangles with proper corner joins (already implemented)

### Phase 2: Visual Polish
5. ✅ Top-down furniture architectural icons (sofa, bed, toilet, etc. — canvas-drawn top-down views)
6. ✅ Clean dimension lines with proper arrowheads — extension lines, gapped dimension line, 45° tick marks
7. ✅ Canvas background & grid refinement (major/minor grid, subtle background)
8. ✅ Toolbar/sidebar styling — SVG icons for tools, undo/redo, export menu; clean minimal aesthetic

### Phase 3: Interaction Improvements  
9. ✅ Drag doors/windows along walls — click to select, drag to slide along wall
10. ✅ Furniture snap-to-wall — auto-snaps edge flush to wall + aligns rotation, green highlight indicator
11. ✅ Selection handles — resize handles at 4 corners (drag to scale), rotation handle above (drag to rotate with 15° snap), dashed selection border
12. ✅ Wall endpoint drag-to-resize — grab selected wall endpoints to move them, with magnetic snap + angle snapping

### Phase 4: 3D Enhancements
13. ✅ Better door/window openings in 3D — proper frame jambs/header, hinged door panel ajar with handle, 4-pane mullion windows, baseboard gaps at doors
14. ✅ Wall materials/colors — 3D walls respect wall.color property (interior color + auto-darkened exterior)
15. ✅ Ceiling — per-room ceiling at wall height, BackSide material visible from inside, off-white
16. ✅ Improved lighting — 3-point setup: warm key sun, cool fill light, rim backlight; hemisphere boost

### Phase 5: Advanced
17. ✅ Door/window catalog — 6 door types (single, double, sliding, french, pocket, bifold) + 5 window types (standard, fixed, casement, sliding, bay) with catalog grid in BuildPanel, unique 2D renderings per type, type selector in PropertiesPanel
18. ✅ Contextual toolbar — floating toolbar appears above selected elements with duplicate, delete, and flip-swing (doors) buttons
19. ✅ Rulers on canvas edges — horizontal/vertical rulers with auto-scaling tick marks (cm/m), mouse position indicators, toggle button
20. ✅ Curved walls — quadratic bezier with drag handle, 2D/3D rendering, door/window placement on curves

### Phase 6: Environment & UX
21. ✅ 3D screenshot — camera button captures 3D view as PNG download
22. ✅ Environment/skybox — improved sky gradient + ground plane with shadow reception
23. ✅ Layer visibility toggles — show/hide furniture, doors, windows, stairs, room labels, dimensions via panel
